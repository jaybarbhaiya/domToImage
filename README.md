DOM to Image Test

This project is a simple POC to test the 2 npm packages "domtoimage" and "file-saver" with which a particular DOM element can be converted to an downloadable "png" image file

The application also makes use of a simple node server which is used for serving the static js, css and html files

To run this project locally, please clone the repo and execute "npm install" to install the dependencies and later "npm start" to run the app.
